# JIRA CSV Formatter

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel] (on [Google+][googleplus])

This is a super simple utility page that can take CSV text content, or a CSV 
file, and output the markup that JIRA can use to generate an HTML table in the 
issue comments. 

**[Run the JIRA CSV Formatter application](http://bennadel.github.io/JIRA-CSV-Formatter/)**.

All the CSV parsing is done on the client - no server required. And, the 
parser will try to calculate the most appropriate field delimiter based on 
how frequently commas, tabs, and colons appear in the input data. There's also
a checkbox to denote whether or not the data includes a header row. If it does
not (include a header row), column headers will be automatically generated 
using the A-Z alphabet.
